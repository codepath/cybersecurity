## Issue Reporting Guidelines

When reporting an issue, please add the following info if available...
1. Please be specific about which instance/platform the issue you're reporting pertains to. Keep in mind there are multiple instances of certain platforms (such as CTF) and course content so be sure to **provide a link** somewhere in the issue.
1. Make sure you have tried to recreate the issue at least once. Transient issues are often the most difficult to track down so please try to ensure the issue can be recreated reliably.
1. Add screenshots if at all possible and any additional notes about how to recreate the issue.
